# ShorOracle
This repository contains a qiskit implementation of the oracle required for the quantum phase estimation part of Shor's algorithm (which is the "quantum part" of Shor's algorithm). It is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205095. The circuit construction uses a modest number of ancilla qubits, at the cost of possibly having longer circuit depth.
